                <h2>My Journey</h2>
                
                <p>I'm Ryan Bishop—an AI strategy consultant with a unique positioning at the intersection of pharmaceutical expertise and emerging AI capability. After over 12 years in pharmaceutical consulting, I'm now pursuing an MA in AI & Digital Transformation while building strategic AI consulting practice focused on healthcare and life sciences organizations.</p>

                <h3>The Transformation</h3>
                
                <p>My transition to AI strategy wasn't a pivot away from pharmaceutical consulting—it's a strategic evolution that multiplies the value of my domain expertise. Having spent over a decade leading HEOR and Market Access projects for global pharmaceutical clients, I recognized that AI represents not just new technology, but a fundamental shift in how organizations can approach strategic decision-making in healthcare contexts.</p>

                <p>Rather than abandoning my hard-won expertise, I'm enhancing it with AI capability, particularly around Responsible AI frameworks and governance. I'm also a professional member of BCS, The Chartered Institute for IT. This combination is increasingly rare and valuable: someone who speaks both languages fluently—pharmaceutical business strategy and AI implementation.</p>

                <h3>The "Ryan v2.0" Positioning</h3>
                
                <p>I think of this evolution as "Ryan v2.0"—not a replacement of who I was, but an augmentation of capabilities. This reflects my core philosophy about AI itself: it's augmentation, not competition. This applies both to how I position myself professionally and how I help organizations think about AI integration.</p>

                <p>My focus is on quality over efficiency. While most AI consultants emphasize speed and cost savings, I help organizations use AI to achieve deeper stakeholder analysis, multi-perspective thinking, and more nuanced strategic decisions—particularly valuable in the complex, regulated environment of pharmaceutical and healthcare organizations.</p>

                <h3>Current Focus</h3>
                
                <p>I'm currently pursuing my MA in AI & Digital Transformation at the University of Southampton, where my coursework directly feeds into my consulting practice. Recent work includes achieving an 80% grade on RAG system design for pharmaceutical RFP optimization, and ongoing focus on algorithm critique and agentic workflow analysis—with particular emphasis on governance and explainability as my primary Responsible AI specialization areas.</p>

                <p>My target clients are pharmaceutical and healthcare decision-makers who need someone who understands both their domain challenges and AI's strategic possibilities. I also work with consulting firms who need pharmaceutical domain expertise for their AI transformation projects.</p>

                <h3>Personal Context</h3>
                
                <p>I live in Surrey, UK with my wife (who runs a dental practice) and our three young children. Balancing family commitments with professional development has taught me the importance of strategic, sustainable approaches—both in my own work and in how I help organizations adopt AI without creating unsustainable demands on their teams.</p>

                <p>My scientific background—biochemistry degree, biomechanics master's, and published cancer research—provides both analytical rigor and healthcare credibility. This foundation, combined with 12 years of consulting experience and emerging AI expertise, creates a unique value proposition for healthcare organizations navigating AI transformation.</p>
