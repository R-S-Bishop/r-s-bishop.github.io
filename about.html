            <h2>The journey</h2>
            
            <p>My career has moved through three distinct phases, each building on the last:</p>
            
            <h3>Cancer research (2008-2011)</h3>
            <p>I started at the Institute of Cancer Research investigating phosphorylation cascades in paediatric tumours - technical lab work combining gene knockdown and early-stage drug screening. Published research that contributed to national and European collaborations. This gave me a foundation in experimental rigor, statistical thinking, and biological complexity.</p>
            
            <p>After three years in oncology research, I completed an MSc in Biomechanics at Roehampton University (2011-2012), which deepened my understanding of quantitative analysis and complex systems.</p>
            
            <h3>Pharmaceutical consulting (2013-2025)</h3>
            <p>I transitioned into pharmaceutical consulting, working at Oxford PharmaGenesis, WG-Access, DRG Abacus, Clarivate, and most recently as Associate Director at RJW&Partners. Over 12 years, I specialized in:</p>
            
            <ul class="open-to-list">
                <li><strong>Value communication</strong> - Translating complex clinical and economic data into stakeholder-specific narratives</li>
                <li><strong>Market access and pricing</strong> - Payer research, reimbursement strategy, HTA submissions across 13 European countries</li>
                <li><strong>Health economics and outcomes research (HEOR)</strong> - Evidence generation, real-world data analysis, economic modelling management</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>I worked across rare diseases, hematology, oncology, and diabetes. My projects ranged from multi-country HTA submissions to payer negotiation training to developing value propositions for novel therapies.</p>
            
            <p>This phase taught me how pharmaceutical organizations actually work - the regulatory constraints, the evidence requirements, the stakeholder complexity, and the business realities that shape decision-making.</p>
            
            <h3>AI strategy (2025-present)</h3>
            <p>After 12 years in consulting, I made a deliberate choice: transition to AI strategy, bringing domain expertise rather than starting from scratch in a new field.</p>
            
            <p>I'm currently pursuing an MA in AI & Digital Transformation at the University of Southampton, building technical knowledge in machine learning, responsible AI governance, and practical implementation. I'm also a professional member of BCS, The Chartered Institute for IT. But the goal isn't to become a data scientist - it's to bridge domain expertise with AI capability.</p>
            
            <p>My focus is on responsible AI implementation: how organizations can adopt AI thoughtfully, accounting for regulatory requirements, evidence standards, and stakeholder needs. Particularly in pharmaceutical and healthcare contexts, but applicable more broadly.</p>
            
            <h2>Why this transition matters</h2>
            
            <p>AI isn't just changing technology - it's changing how decisions get made across every industry. The pharmaceutical sector faces particular challenges: strict regulatory frameworks, high evidence standards, complex stakeholder environments, and real consequences for getting things wrong.</p>
            
            <p>Most AI consultants come from technical backgrounds and try to learn industry domains. I'm taking the opposite path: deep domain expertise plus focused AI capability. That combination is rare and valuable.</p>
            
            <p>There's also a personal dimension. As a father of three young children, I'm navigating the same questions about AI that many families face: how to use these tools thoughtfully, how to teach about them with integrity, how to approach AI as augmentation rather than competition.</p>
            
            <h2>What drives me</h2>
            
            <p>I care about work that's intellectually honest. I avoid buzzwords and hype. I'm interested in where AI genuinely adds value versus where it's expensive complexity. And I believe the most important AI challenges aren't technical - they're strategic, organizational, and human.</p>
            
            <p>The pharmaceutical industry gave me rigorous training in evidence-based decision making. Cancer research taught me experimental design and critical thinking. Family life keeps me grounded in practical realities. And AI studies are giving me the technical foundation to bridge all of this credibly.</p>
            
            <p>This site documents that journey as it unfolds.</p>
